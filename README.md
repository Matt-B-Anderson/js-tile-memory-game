# Overview

This is a memory game. The goal was to create a web-based game using JavaScript to handle all of the logic. The game has 3 difficulties, and is set as a 3x3 grid. When the game starts a sequence of colors will flash on a unique tile. Once the sequence ends the user can click on the tiles to shuffle through the colors until they get to the color they think was in the specific tile; then they would submit their guess and they will get an alert telling them that they were either correct or wrong.

# Development Environment

This was done on VS Code using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML

This was a node-less implementation. There was one external library used call Sweet Alert for alerting.

# Future Work

- One way that I would improve this would be to add a way to track sessions so that this could be hosted and anyone could play without the source code.
- Another way that I would improve this would be to add an additional challenge where the time that a tile flashes with a color is shorter to make it harder to remember.
- Another way that I would improve this would be to add some sort of feature to make this usable to someone who was blind, like the program could read the color and tile position that it was flashing.
